# tp2-NLP

This project was for an assignment of the class on Natural Language Processing (UFMG - 2019). The objective
of the project was to implement and evaluate a POS Tagging model for the Portugues Language, that is, build a 
classification model that classifies a word on a sentence by its gramatical class, such as noun, adjective, etc.

The neural model chosen was an LSTM due to its hability to select context, and it was trained and tested with provided data (available on the .tgz files). The results analysis are available on the pdf file, and all code to build the model is also available.
